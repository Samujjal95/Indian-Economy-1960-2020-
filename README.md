About the Dataset
Economy of the Indian subcontinent was the largest in the world for most of the recorded history up until the onset of colonialism in early 19th century. The economy of India is a middle income developing market economy. It is the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP putting the Asian powerhouse behind the US, China, Japan and Germany and the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). The long-term growth perspective of the Indian economy remains positive due to its young population and corresponding low dependency ratio, healthy savings, and investment rates, increasing globalisation in India and integration into the global economy.

Project Overview:

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of economic data spanning from 1960 to 2020, focusing on GDP and inflation. The goal was to forecast GDP growth and inflation rates for the upcoming five years (2021-2025) using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) forecasting method.

Key contents :-
1.Data Exploration and Manipulation:
2.Forecasting Methodology: 
ARIMA Model: I applied the ARIMA model, which is well-suited for time series forecasting, to predict future values of GDP and inflation.
